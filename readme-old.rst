WIP: provide a couple of easy to use, very basic, printable plots on top of matplotlib

Currently provides scatterplot, histogram, and boxplot.  Documentation forthcoming, but for examples of use and output see the jupyter notebooks in `printable_plots<https://github.com/paultopia/printable_plots>`_, which are my working notebooks for designing these plots.
